- This recipe has a lot going on at once. If you are good at multitasking it
  might go quickly. I wouldn't know. Anyway. We'd recommend pressing the
  tofu first and then starting the coconut rice, both of which take 20-25
  minutes. Also, when you grill the tofu, don't cut it too thick. If the tofu is
  bland, you could use some BBQ sauce.

- This has a lot of ingredients but very few steps. You'll basically end up just combing a bunch of stuff in a bowl  and then adding a dressing. We'd recommend not adding the dressing to the entire bowl if you plan on having leftovers, but adding the dressing every time you have the dish.

- This could probably be a good side but we don't think it turned out super
  well. We don't have a BBQ right now so we used a pan. This made the asparagus
  a bit limp. We also probably over-doused it in the miso sauce... if you were
  using a grill it would have more places to drip off.

  involved a fair bit of prep. A friend brought tortelinni and we used that
  as a base and it mixed nicely. A side note: Yellow squash is basically yellow
  zucchini (which we couldn't find). You can just use one or the other in the
  recipe if you can only find one of the two.

- Eggplant is hard to prepare. Or so I have been told. We had never steamed it until this recipe. Still, with the accompanying sauce, the meal turned out totally fine. I think I'll need to order more eggplant at restaurants to know what to look for in a successful eggplant dish. On another note, shredded eggplant might not be the most visually appealing ingredient to some; if presentation matters quite a bit to you, make sure you have the green onions and maybe get both black and white sesame seeds to top.

** Steps
1) Cut two large slices of sweet potato. Put them into the toaster on medium high. You will do this multiple times once it pops up.
2) Boil some water for the poached egg.
3) Slice two large pieces of tomato. Beefsteak or Heirloom work best. Salt the slices with a pinch of salt.
4) Continue toasting the sweet potato until you can easily poke a fork through it with no resistance. The sides will likely be toasty brown. Once finished, drizzle lightlly with olive oil and add salt and pepper.
5) [&: Poach eggs | 00:03:00 ] Once water is boiled for the eggs, add two capfuls of vinegar and then add the eggs. Poach for 3-4 minutes as per desired level of consistency.
6) Assemble the breakfast stack! Place sweet potato as base, add tomato, then avocado, and finally the egg. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and paprika.

- A few notes. Doing this again, we would maybe:
- 1) replace the chickpeas with chickpea pasta that has been cooked and layer it into the casserole part of the dish.
- 2) Drain some of the tomato juice so it's not so liquid-y.
- Other than that, it's not bad. A bit like ratatouille, but faster to make.
